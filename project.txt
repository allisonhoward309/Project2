I would like to do a project to help the animal shelter that I volunteer at. They have a system where you can check in and out 
as a volunteer, but I would like to help them add an aspect where you can check the dogs in and out too. 
Features:
1. Existing webpage: users can log in and assign themselves a duty.
2. Dog page: provides of list of dogs in the shelter and where to find them.
3. Dog schd: provides an outline of things the shelter needs to do that day with the dog. (i.e. addoption, surgery, furlo)
4. Check dog out: User can schd a time to furlo a dog or can check the dog out for a walk so that staff always knows what the dog is doing. 
5. Message option: The staff can message volunteers if a dog is checked out and the staff needs the dog for some reason. 

Technologies:
 1. Some way to connect existing site with additions
 2. Java
 3. MySQL
 4. C#

I will have to learn whether or not I can connet the page to the existing website or if I will have to build my own log in and out option.
